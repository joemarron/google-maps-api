# Google Maps API

Testing and writing a simple Python function to call the Google Maps API to calculate a user given journey. This was part of experimentation with the API, which was later used to help enhance the employee expenses solution at my workplace at the time. This allowed employee claimed travel to be accurately measured, leading to an increase in the accuracy of carbon emissions reporting.

### Prerequisites
1. You will need a [Google Cloud Platform](https://developers.google.com/maps) account and to have generated an API key. 
2. The function utilises the very useful [googlemaps](https://github.com/googlemaps) package, which helps streamline requests sent to the API and avoids using the Requests package. To install you can run ```pip install googlemaps```.
